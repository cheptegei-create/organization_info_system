# Organization_Info_System

## Description

To have an application that enables the user to view and manage departments, roles,and employees in an organization. Hence, it makes work easier for managers and CEO's to organize departments, roles and employees.
The application offers management solutions to organizations by making it easy and fun. The project enabled me to learn more about node, inquirer, mysql, console.table, and javascript.
